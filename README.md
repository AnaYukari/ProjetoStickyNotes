# ProjetoStickyNotes
This repository was created with the aim of recording my progress in studying Front-end. Here, you will find my prototype of a sticky notes web page.

### Inspiration for the Project
To design the look of my website, I chose to use the Figma website, and below, we can see its initial sketch.
It's good to remember that, for the design, I researched ideas and inspirations on the web, since my intention is to study the basic fundamentals of Front-end.
